Chapter 1: Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?
-----------------------------------------

One hot and humid morning in August 1900, David Hilbert of the
University of Göttingen addressed the International Congress of
Mathematicians in a packed lecture hall at the Sorbonne, Paris. Already
recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians of the age, Hilbert had
prepared a daring lecture. He was going to talk about what was unknown
rather than what had already been proved. This went against all the
accepted conventions, and the audience could hear the nervousness in
Hilbert's voice as he began to lay out his vision for the future of
mathematics. 'Who of us would not be glad to lift the veil behind which
the future lies hidden; to cast a glance at the next advances of our
science and at the secrets of its development during future centuries?'
To herald the new century, Hilbert challenged the audience with a list
of twenty-three problems that he believed should set the course for the
mathematical explorers of the twentieth century.

The ensuing decades saw many of the problems answered, and those who
discovered the solutions make up an illustrious band of mathematicians
known as 'the honours class'. It includes the likes of Kurt Gödel and
Henri Poincaré, along with many other pioneers whose ideas have
transformed the mathematical landscape. But there was one problem, the
eighth on Hilbert's list, which looked as if it would survive the
century without a champion: the Riemann Hypothesis.

...

The announcement came in a letter from Professor Enrico Bombieri. One
could not have asked for a better, more respected source. Bombieri is
one of the guardians of the Riemann Hypothesis and is based at the
prestigious Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, once home to
Einstein and Gödel. He is very softly spoken, but mathematicians always
listen carefully to anything he has to say.

...

Bombieri grew up in Italy, where his prosperous family's vineyards gave
him a taste for the good things in life. He is fondly referred to by
colleagues as 'the Mathematical Aristocrat'. ...

Several years previously, the mathematical world had been set alight by
the news that Alain Connes had turned his attention to trying to crack
the Riemann Hypothesis. ...

Connes is based at France's answer to the Institute in Princeton, the
Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques in Paris. Since his arrival
there in 1979, he has created a completely new language for
understanding geometry. He is not afraid to take the subject to the
extremes of abstraction. ...

Memories were still fresh with the excitement of a few years earlier
when an English mathematician, Andrew Wiles, had announced a proof of
Fermat's Last Theorem in a lecture delivered in Cambridge in June 1993.
Wiles had proved that Fermat had been right in his claim that the
equation x^n + y^n = z^n has no solutions when n is bigger than 2. As
Wiles laid down his chalk at the end of the lecture, the champagne
bottles started popping and the cameras began flashing.

...

As the French mathematician Henri Poincaré wrote, 'The scientist does
not study Nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights
in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful. If Nature were not
beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if Nature were not worth
knowing, life would not be worth living.'

...

As the Cambridge mathematician G.H. Hardy said in his famous book *A
Mathematician's Apology*, '317 is a prime not because we think so, or
because our minds are shaped in one way or another, but *because it is
so*, because mathematical reality is built that way.'

...

Indeed, even in the 1940s G.H. Hardy was of the same mind: 'both Gauss
and lesser mathematicians may be justified in rejoicing that here is one
science [number theory] at any rate whose very remoteness from ordinary
human activities should keep it gentle and clean'.

...

Every time you place an order on a website, your computer is using the
security provided by the existence of prime numbers with a hundred
digits. The system is called RSA after its three inventors. So far, over
a million primes have already been put to use to protect the world of
electronic commerce.

...

On May 24, 2000, to mark the 100th anniversary of Hilbert's challenge,
mathematicians and the press gathered in the Collège de France in Paris
to hear the announcement of a fresh set of seven problems to challenge
the mathematical community for the new millennium. They were proposed by
a small group of the world's finest mathematicians, including Andrew
Wiles and Alain Connes. The seven problems were new except for one that
had appeared on Hilbert's list: the Riemann Hypothesis. In obeisance to
the capitalist ideals that shaped the twentieth century, these
challenges come with some extra spice. The Riemann Hypothesis and the
other six problems now have a price tag of one million dollars apiece.
Incentive indeed for Bombieri's fictional young physicist -- if glory
weren't enough.

The idea for the Millennium Problems was the brainchild of Landon T.
Clay, a Boston businessman who made his money in trading mutual funds on
a buoyant stock market. Despite dropping out of mathematics at Harvard
he has a passion for the subject, a passion he wants to share. ...

Clay's seven million dollars is not the first time that money has been
offered for solutions to mathematical problems. In 1997 Wiles picked up
75,000 Deutschmarks for his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, thanks to a
prize offered in 1908 by Paul Wolfskehl. ...

Clay believes that mathematicians receive little reward or recognition
for their labours. For example, there is no Nobel Prize for Mathematics
that they can aspire to. Instead, the award of a Fields Medal is
considered the ultimate prize in the mathematical world. In contrast to
Nobel prizes, which tend to be awarded to scientists at the end of their
careers for achievements long past, Fields Medals are restricted to
mathematicians below the age of forty. This is not because of the
generally held belief that mathematicians burn out at an early age. John
Fields, who conceived of the idea and provided funds for the prize,
wanted its award to spur on the most promising mathematicians to even
greater achievements. The medals are awarded every four years on the
occasion of the International Congress of Mathematicians. The first ones
were awarded in Oslo in 1936.

The age limit is strictly adhered to. Despite Andrew Wiles's
extraordinary achievement in proving Fermat's Last Theorem, the Fields
Medal committee weren't able to award him a medal at the Congress in
Berlin in 1998, the first opportunity after the final proof was
accepted, for he was born in 1953. They did have a special medal struck
to honour Wiles's achievement. But it still does not compare to being a
member of the illustrious club of Fields Medal winners. The recipients
include many of the key players in our drama: Enrico Bombieri, Alain
Connes, Atle Selberg, Paul Cohen, Alexandre Grothendieck, Alan Baker,
Pierre Deligne. Those names account for nearly a fifth of the medals
ever awarded.

...

As G.H. Hardy explained, 'languages die and mathematical ideas do not.
"Immortality" may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the
best chance of whatever it may mean.'

...

The Riemann Hypothesis is the longitude of mathematics. A solution to
the Riemann Hypothesis offers the prospect of charting the misty waters
of the vast ocean of numbers. It represents just a beginning in our
understanding of Nature's numbers. If we can only find the secret of how
to navigate the primes, who knows what else lies out there, waiting for
us to discover?


Chapter 2: The Atoms of Arithmetic
----------------------------------

Two centuries before Bombieri's April Fool had teased the mathematical
world, equally exciting news was being trumpeted from Palermo by another
Italian, Giuseppe Piazzi. From his observatory Piazzi had detected a new
planet that orbited the Sun somewhere between the orbits of Mars and
Jupiter. Christened Ceres, it was much smaller than the seven major
planets then known, but its discovery on January 1, 1801, was regarded
by everyone as a great omen for the future of science in the new
century.

...

Carl Friedrich Gauss had taken the minimal data that had been recorded
for the planet's path and applied a new method he had recently developed
to estimate where Ceres could be found at any future date.

...

Gauss was born into a labourer's family in Brunswick, Germany, in 1777.
At the age of three he was correcting his father's arithmetic. At the
age of nineteen, his discovery of a beautiful geometric construction of
a 17-sided shape convinced him that he should dedicate his life to
mathematics. ...

Just as the telescope had allowed astronomers to see new worlds, the
development of the clock calculator helped mathematicians to discover in
the universe of numbers new patterns which had been hidden from view for
generations. Even today, Gauss's clocks are central to the security of
the Internet, which utilises calculators whose clock faces bear more
hours than there are atoms in the observable universe.

...

Gauss's patron was the Duke of Brunswick, Carl Wilhelm Ferdinand.
Ferdinand's family had always supported the culture and economy of their
dukedom. Indeed, his father had founded the Collegium Carolinum, one of
the oldest technical universities in Germany. ... Ferdinand first came
across Gauss in 1791, and was so impressed with his abilities that he
offered to finance the young man to attend the Collegium Carolinum so
that he could realise his obvious potential.

It was with much gratitude that Gauss dedicated his first book to the
duke in 1801. This book, entitled *Disquisitiones Arithmeticae*,
collected together many of Gauss's discoveries about the properties of
numbers that he had recorded in his diaries. It is generally
acknowledged as the book that heralded the birth of number theory as a
subject in its own right, not just a ragbag collection of observations
about numbers. Its publication is responsible for making the subject of
number theory, as Gauss always liked to call it, 'the Queen of
Mathematics'. ...

The librarian of the great ancient Greek research institute in
Alexandria was the first person we know of to have produced tables of
primes. Like some ancient mathematical Mendeleev, Eratosthenes in the
third century BC discovered a reasonably painless procedure for
determining which numbers are prime in a list of, say, the first 1,000
numbers. ... The procedure was later christened *the sieve of
Eratosthenes.* ...

The formula for generating the Fibonacci numbers is based upon a special
number called the golden ratio, a number which begins 1.61803...

It is not just Fibonacci numbers that one finds in Nature. The animal
kingdom also knows about prime numbers. There are two species of cicada
called *Magicicada septendecim* and *Magicicada tredecim* which often
live in the same environment. They have a life cycle of exactly 17 and
13 years, respectively. For all but their last year they remain in the
ground feeding on the sap of tree roots. Then, in their last year, they
metamorphose from nymphs into fully formed adults and emerge en masse
from the ground. It is an extraordinary event as, every 17 years,
*Magicicada septendecim* takes over the forest in a single night. They
sing loudly, mate, eat, lay eggs, then die six weeks later. The forest
goes quiet for another 17 years. But why has each species chosen a prime
number of years as the length of their life cycle?

There are several possible explanations. Since both species have evolved
prime number life cycles, they will be synchronised to emerge in the
same year very rarely. In fact they will have to share the forest only
every 221 = 17 x 13 years. ...


### Proof, the mathematician's travelogue

dmittedly, Fermat's Last Theorem was always called a theorem and never
a conjecture. But that is unusual, and probably came about because
Fermat claimed in notes that he scribbled in his copy of Diophantus's
*Arithmetica* that he had a marvellous proof that was unfortunately too
large to write in the margin of the page. Fermat never recorded his
supposed proof anywhere, and his marginal comments became the biggest
mathematical tease in the history of the subject. Until Andrew Wiles
provided an argument, a proof of why Fermat's equations really had no
interesting solutions, it actually remained a hypothesis -- merely
wishful thinking.

...

The Cambridge mathematician G. H. Hardy, author of *A Mathematician's
Apology*, used to describe the process of mathematical discovery and
proof in terms of mapping out distant landscapes: 'I have always thought
of a mathematician as in the first instance an observer, a man who gazes
at a distant range of mountains and notes down his observations.' ...

As the French mathematician André Weil expressed it, 'Rigour is to the
mathematician what morality is to men.' ...

Mathematics may be an ethereal subject confined to the mind, but its
lack of tangible reality is more than compensated for by the certitude
that proof provides.

...

Hardy encapsulates perfectly this tension between creation and discovery
that every mathematician battles with: 'I believe that mathematical
reality lies outside us, that our function is to discover or observe it
and that the theorems which we prove and which we describe
grandiloquently as our "creations" are simply our notes of our
observations.' But at other times he favoured a more artistic
description of the process of doing mathematics: 'Mathematics is not a
contemplative but a creative subject,' he wrote in *A Mathematician's
Apology*, a book Graham Greene ranked with Henry James's notebooks as
the best account of what it is like to be a creative artist.


### Euclid's fables

More than any other Greek mathematician, Euclid is regarded as the
father of the art of proof. He was part of the research institute that
the Greek leader Ptolemy I established in Alexandria around 300
BC. There, Euclid wrote one of the most influential
textbooks in all of recorded history: *The Elements*. ...

But as Cambridge don Hardy liked to say, 'Every fool can ask questions
about prime numbers that the wisest man cannot answer.' ...

Fermat discovered a curious fact about those prime numbers that leave
remainder 1 on division by 4 -- examples are 5, 13, 17 and 29. Such prime
numbers can always be written as the sum of two squares -- for example,
29 = 2^5 + 5^2. ...

On Christmas Day, 1640, Fermat wrote of his discovery -- that certain
primes could be expressed as the sum of two squares -- in a letter to a
French monk called Marin Mersenne. Mersenne's interests were not
confined to liturgical matters. He loved music and was the first to
develop a coherent theory of harmonics. He also loved numbers. Mersenne
and Fermat corresponded regularly about their mathematical discoveries,
and Mersenne broadcast many of Fermat's claims to a wider audience.
Mersenne became renowned for his role as an international scientific
clearing house through which mathematicians could disseminate their
ideas.

...

Mersenne realised that if n was not prime then there was no chance that
2^n − 1 was going to be prime. But now he boldly claimed that, for n up
to 257, 2^n - 1 would be prime precisely if n one of the following
numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 31, 67, 127, 257. ...

Mathematicians believe that if one continues Mersenne's list, there will
be infinitely many choices for n which will make Mersenne's numbers 2^n
− 1 into prime numbers. But we are still missing a proof that this guess
is true. We are still waiting for a modern day Euclid to prove that
Mersenne's primes never run dry. Or perhaps this far-off peak is just a
mathematical mirage.

...

Mathematicians were quite content with a more experimental approach to
their subject, where in an increasingly mechanised world results were
justified by their practical applications. In the eighteenth century,
however, there arrived a mathematician who would rekindle a sense of the
value of proof in mathematics. The Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler,
born in 1707, came up with explanations for many of the patterns that
Fermat and Mersenne had discovered but failed to account for. ...


### Euler, the mathematical eagle

Euler was the son of a clergyman who hoped that his son would join him
in the church. The young Euler's precocious mathematical talents,
however, had brought him to the notice of the powers that be. Euler was
soon being courted by the academies throughout Europe. He had been
tempted to join the Academy in Paris, which by this time had become the
world's centre of mathematical activity. He chose instead to accept an
offer made to him in 1726 to join the Academy of Sciences in St
Petersburg, the capstone for Peter the Great's campaign to improve
education in Russia. ... Laden down with gifts, it took the young Euler
seven weeks to complete the long journey by boat, on foot and by post
wagon, and in May 1727 he finally arrived in St Petersburg to pursue his
mathematical dreams. His subsequent output was so extensive that the St
Petersburg Academy was still publishing material that had been housed in
their archives some fifty years after Euler's death in 1783.

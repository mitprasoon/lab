Introduction to Fortran 90
==========================

This directory contains example code I wrote while reading
[*Introduction to Fortran 90*][1] Version 1.0 written by Rob Davies,
Alan Rea, and Dimitris Tsaptsinos.

The code in this directory were run using `gfortran 8.2.0`, i.e, GNU
Fortran (Homebrew GCC 8.2.0) 8.2.0 on macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6.

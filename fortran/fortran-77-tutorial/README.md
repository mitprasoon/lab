Fortran 77 Tutorial
===================

This directory contains example code I wrote while reading
[*Fortran 77 Tutorial*][1] by Stanford University. This tutorial was
written by Erik Boman, Sarah T. Whitlock, and Paul H. Hargrove. A PDF
version of this tutorial is available [here][2].

The code in this directory were run using `gfortran 8.2.0`, i.e, GNU
Fortran (Homebrew GCC 8.2.0) 8.2.0 on macOS High Sierra Version 10.13.6.

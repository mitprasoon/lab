This document contains examples I wrote while reading the book [*Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs*](https://git.io/sicp.pdf), second edition
by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman.

See [reading/books/sicp.md][notes] for notes I have taken while reading this
book.
